# eCars
This work is devoted to the analysis of data in the field of electric cars. This area was chosen because recently the demand for electric vehicles has been growing at a breakneck pace, and there are more and more companies and car models that are somewhat superior to each other. 

#### We took the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geoffnel/evs-one-electric-vehicle-dataset

We didn't take too much data, we stopped at 100.  As parameters, we selected acceleration, maximum speed, power reserve, economy of the car, type of drive (front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, all-wheel drive), body type, number of seats in the car and its price.
